Bresenham's line algorithm is a line drawing algorithm that determines the points of an n-dimensional raster that should be selected in order to form a close approximation to a straight line between two points. It is commonly used to draw line primitives in a bitmap image (e.g. on a computer screen), as it uses only integer addition, subtraction, and bit shifting, all of which are very cheap operations in historically common computer architectures. It is an incremental error algorithm, and one of the earliest algorithms developed in the field of computer graphics. The extension to the original algorithm may, called midpoint circle algorithm, be used for drawing circles.

While algorithms such as Wu's algorithm are also frequently used in modern computer graphics because they can support antialiasing, Bresenham's line algorithm is still important because of its speed and simplicity. The algorithm is used in hardware such as plotters and in the graphics chips of modern graphics cards. It can also be found in many software graphics libraries. Because the algorithm is very simple, it is often implemented in either the firmware or the graphics hardware of modern graphics cards.

The label "Bresenham" is used today for a family of algorithms extending or modifying Bresenham's original algorithm.

// Why do we need `dx` and `dy`?

Bresenham's algorithm is all about minimizing the error when choosing which pixel to illuminate next. To achieve this, it uses a decision variable that is based on the differences in x and y. Specifically:

- `dx` represents the total number of pixels we would need to move in the x-direction to go from the start point to the end point.
- `dy` represents the total number of pixels we would need to move in the y-direction to do the same.

The main idea is to compare the horizontal and vertical distances (`dx` and `dy`). The larger distance dictates the "dominant" axis of movement (i.e., if the line is more horizontal or more vertical). This comparison allows the algorithm to decide whether to move diagonally, horizontally, or vertically at any given step.

// Why do we need `sx` and `sy`?

These values (`sx` and `sy`) determine the direction we need to move in for both x and y axes. Remember, we're trying to draw a line between two points, and that line can be in any orientation: it might go from left-to-right or right-to-left, from top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top.

- `sx` tells us whether we should increase x (move to the right) or decrease x (move to the left) at each step:
  - If `x1 < x2`, it means our start point is to the left of our end point, so we need to move right, making `sx = 1`.
  - If `x1 >= x2`, it means our start point is to the right or at the same x-position as our end point, so we need to move left, making `sx = -1`.

- Similarly, `sy` tells us whether to increase y (move down) or decrease y (move up) at each step:
  - If `y1 < y2`, it means our start point is above our end point, so we need to move down, making `sy = 1`.
  - If `y1 >= y2`, it means our start point is below or at the same y-position as our end point, so we need to move up, making `sy = -1`.

Using `sx` and `sy` ensures that we always move towards our end point, no matter the relative positions of the start and end points. This is crucial for the algorithm to work correctly in all cases.
