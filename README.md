# ComputerGraphics2023

## Overview
This project is a custom 3D rendering engine developed in C++. It supports different rendering modes including Wireframe, Rasterization, and Ray Tracing. The engine is capable of handling object transformations, camera control, light calculations, and texture mapping.

## Features
- **Multiple Rendering Modes**: Wireframe, Rasterisation, and Ray Tracing.
- **Camera Control**: Movement and rotation of the camera in 3D space.
- **Lighting**: Basic lighting models with support for shadows, reflection and refraction.
- **Object Loading**: Load 3D objects from `.obj` files with material `.mtl` support.
- **Photon Mapping**: For advanced lighting in Ray Tracing mode.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler
- SDL2 library for creating windows and handling events
- GLM library for mathematics

## Installation
1. Ensure you have SDL2 and GLM installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Compile the code using:  
  ```bash
  make 
  ```
4. You may need to use:  
  ```bash 
  make clean
  ```  
  first.  
5. Run the compiled executable.

## Usage
- Run the program. A window will open displaying the rendered scene.
- Use keyboard inputs to interact with the scene:
    - Arrow keys for camera movement.
    - `W` and `S` for moving the camera forward and backward.
    - `A` and `D` for camera rotation.
    - Number keys `1`, `2`, `3` to switch between Wireframe, Rasterisation, and Ray Tracing modes.
    - Other keys for specific actions like light movement and camera tilt.
- Close the window by `esc`or terminate the program to exit.

## Code Structure
- `main()`: The entry point of the program. Initializes the window and enters the render loop.
- Rendering Functions:
    - `drawWireframeScene()`: Renders the scene in wireframe mode.
    - `drawRasterisedScene()`: Renders the scene using rasterization.
    - `drawRayTracedScene()`: Renders the scene using ray tracing.
- Utility Functions:
    - `loadOBJWithMaterials()`: Loads a 3D object with materials.
    - `handleEvent()`: Handles user input events.

### The procedure for week7:  
The following is 3 different light position of the object:  
(0,0.5,0):  
![(0,0.5,0).png](photos%2F%280%2C0.5%2C0%29.png)  
(0,0.5,0.5):  
![(0,0.5,0.5).png](photos%2F%280%2C0.5%2C0.5%29.png)  
(0,0.8,0):  
![(0,0.8,0).png](photos%2F%280%2C0.8%2C0%29.png)  
Movable light source (it is slow due to slow rendering after each move):

### The procedure for week4:  
Starting of the week4, stuck at task6(showing 'stars' but not same one as given).  
So i decided to connect the stars as the line first, and found the problem:  
![week4,1.JPG](photos%2Fweek4%2C1.JPG)  
![week4,2.jpg](photos%2Fweek4%2C2.jpg)  
I change the the code: float zi = vertexPosition.z - cameraPosition.z  to 
float zi = cameraPosition.z - vertexPosition.z; and fixed the problem.  
![week4,3.jpg](photos%2Fweek4%2C3.jpg)  
The filledTriangle is not fully right, I did some updates on that and fix the colour part.
