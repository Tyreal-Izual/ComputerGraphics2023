# ComputerGraphics2023

The following is what I'm done in CG2023:

(the README of CG2023 is updating...... )  
  
Improvement and new feature for CW:  
Smooth and elegant soft shadow (Area Lights with Jittered Sampling)

Rough attempt at soft shadow with multipoint light sources (area light)

The procedure for week7:  
The following is 3 different light position of the object:  
(0,0.5,0):

(0,0.5,0.5):

(0,0.8,0):  
![(0,0.8,0).png](photos%2F%280%2C0.8%2C0%29.png)  
Movable light source (it is slow due to slow rendering after each move):

The procedure for week4:  
Starting of the week4, stuck at task6(showing 'stars' but not same one as given).  
So i decided to connect the stars as the line first, and found the problem:  
![week4,1.JPG](photos%2Fweek4%2C1.JPG)  
![week4,2.jpg](photos%2Fweek4%2C2.jpg)  
I change the the code: float zi = vertexPosition.z - cameraPosition.z  to 
float zi = cameraPosition.z - vertexPosition.z; and fixed the problem.  
![week4,3.jpg](photos%2Fweek4%2C3.jpg)  
The filledTriangle is not fully right, I did some updates on that and fix the colour part.
