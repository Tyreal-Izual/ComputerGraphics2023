The procedure for week4:

Starting of the week4, stuck at task6(showing 'stars' but not same one as given).

So i decided to connect the stars as the line first, and found the problem:

I change the the code: float zi = vertexPosition.z - cameraPosition.z  to 
float zi = cameraPosition.z - vertexPosition.z; and fixed the problem.

The filledTriangle is not fully right, I did some updates on that and fix the colour part.
