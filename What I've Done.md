## Features that I've done

### Core Features (Bare Pass: 40%)
- **OBJ Geometry File Loading**: The engine can load 3D objects from `.obj` files.
- **Wireframe 3D Scene Rendering**: Renders scenes in wireframe mode, highlighting the structure of objects.
- **Export of Individual Frames and Creation of Animated Video**: Supports exporting frames and compiling them into a video.
- **Clear Incremental Evolution of Codebase**: Demonstrated through consistent updates and commits on GitHub.

### Features for 40s Mark
- **OBJ Material File Loading**: Supports loading material information from `.mtl` files.
- **Flat Colour 3D Scene Rasterising**: Renders scenes with flat colours.
- **Keyboard Control of Camera Orientation**: Using orientation matrix for intuitive camera control.

### Features for 50s Mark
- **Hard Shadow**: Implements hard shadows without soft edges. (Already implemented Soft Shadows)
- **Ambient Lighting**: Includes a minimum threshold or universal light supplement.
- **Diffuse Lighting**: Factors in proximity and angle-of-incidence for lighting.
- **Simple Animation**: Supports basic animations like orbit, lookAt, fly-through, and simple transformations.

### Features for 60s Mark
- **Gouraud shading**: Advanced lighting techniques for Rough Attempt Gouraud shading.
- **Soft Shadows (Rough Attempt)**: Utilizes multi-point light sources to create rudimentary soft shadows. (Already implemented Elegant Soft Shadows)
- **Reflective Materials**: Includes material: mirror.
- **Specular Lighting**: Features a clearly visible specular highlight or "spot".

### Features for Low 70s Mark
- **Elegant Soft Shadows**: Smooth and refined implementation of soft shadows.
- **Refractive Materials**: Implements materials that refract light.

### Features for Above 75% Mark
- **Environment Maps**: Used in conjunction with reflective materials for more realistic rendering.
- **Photon Maps and Caustics**: Advanced lighting techniques for realistic light behavior.
